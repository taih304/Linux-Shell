# Fundamental concepts

The Internet protocol stack consists of five layers: the physical, link, network, transport, and application layers

# IoT protocol stack

**Infrastructure**: IPv6 IPv4, 6LowPAN

**Identification**: IPv6, URIs, uCode

**Discovery** (Used to discover IoT devices): mDNS, Bonjour

**Semantic**: JSON-LD, Web Thing model

### Definitions

**uCode**: The ucode system (written in lower case "ucode") is an identification number system that can be used to identify things in the real world uniquely. The ucode system uses 128 bit code for unique naming of things so there are 340282366920938463463374607431768211455 or 3.4 x 10^38 different codes. ucode is supported by the uID center, which is a non-profit organisation.

**Web Thing**: A Web Thing (or simply Thing) is a digital representation of a physical object accessible via a RESTful Web API. An examples of Web Things is an MCU board which have TCP/IP suite.
