# Linux vs BSD

Both Linux and the BSDs are free and open-source, Unix-like operating systems. ``BSD`` stands for ``Berkeley Software Distribution`` as it was originally a set of modifications to Bell Unix created at the University of California, Berkeley. It eventually grew into a complete operating system and now there are multiple different BSDs.
# Debian

From the Debian base, many other famous distributions were built on it (eg: Ubuntu, Raspian, Armbian, ...). With a unique package management ``apt``, Linux development with Debian couldn't be any easier than that.
