Run a ``sh`` file: ``./test.sh``, ``. test.sh``, ``sh test.sh`` and ``source test.sh``.

A file with no ``sh`` extension but include Bash script file can be run normally.

The Shebang line is present at the top of the script, e.g:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
```

**When should shell programming/scripting not be used ?**

When the task is very much complex like writing the entire payroll processing system.

Where there is a high degree if productivity required.

When it needs or involves different software tools.
