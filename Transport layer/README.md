The Internet’s transport layer transports application-layer messages between application endpoints. In the Internet **there are two transport protocols**, **TCP and UDP**, either of which can transport application-layer messages.

**TCP** provides a **connection-oriented service** to its applications. This service includes guaranteed delivery of application-layer messages to the destination and flow control (that is, sender/receiver speed matching). **TCP** also breaks long messages into shorter segments and provides a congestion-control mechanism, so that a source throttles its transmission rate when the network is congested.

The **UDP** protocol provides a **connectionless service** to its applications. This is a no-frills service that provides no reliability, no flow control, and no congestion control. In this book, we’ll refer to a transport-layer packet as a **segment**.
