### Basic shell script

```sh
#!/bin/sh
echo "hello world"
```

``#!/bin/sh``: will export which path of shell to compile, some compiler bypass this command.

Can be both ``#!bin/sh`` and ``#!bin/bash``

### Run shell script

**hello.sh**

```shell
chmod 775 hello.sh
./hello.sh
```

``chmod`` might not need if the file is readable

### Conditional state

```sh
a=9
b=10
if [ $a -gt $b ] 
then 
	echo "A is greater than B" 
else 
	echo "A is less than B" 
fi
```

```
A is less than B
```
