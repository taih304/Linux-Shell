# [Fundamental concepts]()

# Install

## Set up the repository

1. Update the ``apt`` package index and install packages to allow ``apt`` to use a repository over HTTPS:

```sh
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release
```

2. Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:

```sh
$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```

3. Use the following command to set up the repository:

```sh
$ echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

## Install Docker Engine

1. Update the ``apt`` package index, and install the latest version of Docker Engine, containerd, and Docker Compose, or go to the next step to install a specific version:

```sh
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin
```

In Ubuntu 16.04, there is error when performing this step:

```
E: Unable to locate package docker-compose-plugin
```

While those steps run smoothly on Ubuntu 20.04.

However, this error doesn't effect the docker operation in Ubuntu 16.04.

Once successfully installed, command ``docker`` is available.

## Issue

If your account is not added to ``docker`` group, running the program that related to docker will cause the issue like:

```
Could not run `docker` 
Error: exit status 1
Ensure you have the latest version of `docker-ce` installed 
See: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-docker-ce
```

To solve that problem: ``sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}``. If setting successfully, ``docker`` will be listed out by ``groups`` command as it has been added to user.

# Implementations

## Docker commands

``sudo service docker start`` (SysV) or ``sudo systemctl start docker`` (systemd): Start docker service

``sudo docker run hello-world``: Run docker image ``hello-world``. If running it for the first time after installed, it will be pulled from the docker hub

Its log message while pulling:

```
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
2db29710123e: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:7d246653d0511db2a6b2e0436cfd0e52ac8c066000264b3ce63331ac66dca625
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest
```

(Then the log message will print out the content of ``hello-world`` image)

``sudo docker pull hello-world``: Only pull ``hello-world`` and not run it after successfully pulling

``sudo docker images``: List all available images and their information

E.g

```
username$hostname:~$ sudo docker images
REPOSITORY    TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
hello-world   latest    feb5d9fea6a5   11 months ago   13.3kB
```

``sudo docker image rm image_id``: Remove a docker with ID ``image_id``. ``sudo docker image rm -f image_id``: Force to remove docker

``sudo docker inspect ubuntu``: Provide docker named ``ubuntu``'s information in JSON format

## Container commands 

**Create a container**, e.g ``ubuntu-container`` from an image, e.g ``ubuntu`` image: ``docker run --name ubuntu-container -d -t -i ubuntu``. 

* ``-d`` (shorthand for --detach) sets the container to run in the background, in detached mode
* ``-t``: Set a pseudo-TTY attached
* ``-i``: Keep STDIN attached, which prevents the ``sh`` process from exiting immediately.

After creating that container, connect to it: ``docker exec -it ubuntu-container /bin/bash``. You will then be prompted into the ``root@<host_name>`` CLI.

``sudo docker ps``: List all running container

``sudo docker ps -a``: List all running or exited containers

``docker run --rm``: With ``--rm`` flag, Docker also removes the anonymous volumes associated with the container when the container is removed.

``docker rm <container-name>``: Remove a container named ``<container-name>``
