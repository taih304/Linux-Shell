The ``.netrc`` file contains login and initialization information used by the auto-login process. It generally resides in the userâ€™s home directory (``~/``), but a location outside of the home directory can be set.

``.netrc`` file by default is not existed in Ubuntu 20.04. User has to create this file to implement.

Format of a line in the ``.netrc`` file is

```sh
machine machine_name login username password password_value
```

## Setup netrc for Github

**Step 1**: Go to ``Github Settings`` -> ``Developer settings`` -> ``Tokens (classic)``. Then choose ``Generate new token`` -> ``Generate new token (classic)``.

**Step 2**: Name the Personal access token then choose the scope by setting **Select scopes**. Chosen values in **Select scopes** will result in the returned value in the API query.

**Step 4**: A new personal access token has been created. Copy that token for later user.

In this example, the token is ``personal_access_token_in_hash_value`` for later used in **Step 5**.

**Step 5**: For accessing Github by API (e.g by ``curl``), setup the ``.netrc`` file to:

```
machine github.com login tranphucvinh password personal_access_token_in_hash_value
```

Then access the API by ``curl``: ``curl https://api.github.com/user -L --netrc``

For Github repository with HTTPS without authentication request every time clone/push/pull, setup the ``.netrc`` file to:

```
machine github.com login tranphucvinh password personal_access_token_in_hash_value
```

So for the whole ``.netrc`` file to support both API query by curl and HTTPS repository without authentication, the whole ``.netrc`` file will be:

```
machine github.com login tranphucvinh password personal_access_token_in_hash_value
machine github.com login tranphucvinh password personal_access_token_in_hash_value
```
