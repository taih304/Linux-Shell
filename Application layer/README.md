## Application layer

**An application-layer protocol** defines how an application’s processes, running on different end systems, pass messages to each other.

An application-layer protocol is distributed over multiple end systems, with the application in one end system using the protocol to exchange packets of information with the application in another end system. We’ll refer to this packet of information at the application layer as a message.

Let’s look at an example. **The Web** is a client-server application that allows users to obtain documents from Web servers on demand. The Web application consists of many components, including a standard for document formats (that is, HTML), Web browsers (for example, Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer), **Web servers** (for example, Apache and Microsoft servers), and an application-layer protocol.
