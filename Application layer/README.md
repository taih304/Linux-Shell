## Application layer

**An application-layer protocol** defines how an application’s processes, running on different end systems, pass messages to each other.

An application-layer protocol is distributed over multiple end systems, with the application in one end system using the protocol to exchange packets of information with the application in another end system. We’ll refer to this packet of information at the application layer as a message.
