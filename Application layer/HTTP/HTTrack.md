**HTTrack** is a free software allows you to download a World Wide Web site from the Internet to a local directory, building recursively all directories, getting HTML, images, and other files from the server to your computer.

Simply install httrack on Linux and type ``httrack`` on terminal to start the software.

With webstie that requires authentication, httrack will just only download the main site content (as it can't do authentication).

For example: httrack for ``https://smarthome-thesis-bku.herokuapp.com/`` will only download the main webpage that requires user to login
