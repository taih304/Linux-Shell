* **Ethernet** is a protocol for local network of computers, workstations and devices.
* It has bus topology consisting of 8 lines or 4 TX/RX pairs.
* Speed of 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps and 4 Gbps.

A **hub** is a physical-layer device that **acts on individual bits** rather than **frames**. When a bit, representing a zero or a one, arrives from one interface, **the hub simply re-creates the bit**, **boosts its energy strength**, and **transmits the bit onto all the other interfaces**. Thus, Ethernet with a hub-based star topology is also a broadcast LAN—**whenever a hub receives a bit from one of its interfaces**, **it sends a copy out on all of its other interfaces**. In particular, **if a hub receives frames from two different interfaces at the same time**, **a collision occurs and the nodes that created the frames must retransmit**.

Historically, an Ethernet was initially conceived of as a segment of coaxial cable. **The early 10BASE-2 and 10BASE-5 standards specify 10 Mbps Ethernet over two types of coaxial cable, each limited in length to 500 meters**. Longer runs could be obtained by using **a repeater**—**a physical-layer device that receives a signal on the input side, and regenerates the signal on the output side**.
